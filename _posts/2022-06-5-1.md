I wanted to complete the challenge using hardhat. 
Opened the ethernaut page, got a contract addressinfo42(),
Clicked on create instance, and an instance was created.

Developer tool was small, also needed to learn hardhat, so I used hardhat

Using hardhat to interact with the instance address, as instance is the solidity code of that address

ethers.getContractAt("Instance", add1)

address given, contract name we can find out from the ethernaut soldiity source code

connected with that address using hardhat, but for that :
setup rinkeby network, url and private key of metamask, set other params like chainId and gaslimit, but those are more specific for custom testnets

Then also adjusted compiler versions to accomodate multiple compilers

Then as specified, called the info() method present at that address
This gave the hint of calling info1()
which gave hint info2("hello"),
which hgave infoNum(), 
which gave info42(),theMethodName(), method7123949(), 
password(), then authenticate("ethernaut0"), finally calling getCleared() to see if the level was cleared. This getCleared() is used in every level to
determine the success of the level. A flag is set to true, if the level is cleared

Then finally clicking on "submit instance" will take us to  level completion page.

Note: don't store passwords in public variable, as they can be accessed using getter functions.
